# Customer Onboarding Automation
This is an RPA bot that scrapes customer data from online forms and collates the data into an excel sheet. This reduces the manual effort of onboarding, and ensures data accuracy and validity. 

## How to run
1. Clone this repo or download the zip file.
2. Open the project in UiPath Studio. We recommend using UiPath Academic Alliance Studio 2022.4.1, as this is the version it has been tested on. Unexpected errors may occur when using other versions.
3. Install Microsoft Edge and its UiPath extension. Instructions can be found (here)[https://docs.uipath.com/studio/standalone/2023.4/user-guide/extension-for-edge-chromium]
4. Open the file Main.xaml
5. Click Run/Debug
Microsoft Edge windows will open during the process. Do not interrupt the process. When the process is complete, a dialogue will appear with the message 'Process complete'.

Open cust_data.xlsx to view the sorted and validated data.
